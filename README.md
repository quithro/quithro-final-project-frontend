# News Explorer: Front End

This is the front-end project creating a server for the News Explorer application.

Features
The website should have two main features:

When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website will send a request to the News API service, find all the relevant articles over the last week, and display a list of cards for each of them.
It will display all articles a user saves in a special section of the website.

The front end of the website consists of two pages:

The main page with a search box
The page with saved news items where all the liked materials are displayed

Infrastructure
You'll also need to configure two more tools: Git and Create React App.

You'll use Git to store your project in a public repository.

As for the Create React App, it'll help you to create a template in which you'll write the front end for your React project.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
